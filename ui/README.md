# Taho Extension Frontend üêï

![Screen + Browser Mock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1918798/125732391-29da0e00-0796-49bb-895d-35de187b141d.png)

Welcome to the frontend portion of the Taho browser extension. This is the
React portion of the codebase which handles UI related states, and communicates
with the background script API `@tallyho/tally-background`. The intent is for
all communication with outside APIs to strictly happen within
`@tallyho/tally-background`, not here. This frontend only contains what's
needed to provide the visual goodness!

## Prerequisites ‚úçÔ∏è

## Running in development üöÄ

First, install the node modules:

```bash
yarn install
```

If you run into `The engine "node" is incompatible with this module.`, try adding `--ignore-engines` for now.

Then, start up the dev server:

```bash
yarn start
```

Load the unpacked extension for your web browser via the `/build` directory. Currently builds are tested to work on Chrome and Brave browser.

## Primary file structure üìÅ

```
/pages
# Folder for components that serve the components for pages, primarily tabs

/components/GroupName/GroupNameComponentName.js
# Components are grouped by concern, like TabBar, where the primary component
usually is named the same as the group. All components here are prefixed
by the folder they're in.

/components/GroupName/__tests__/GroupNameComponentName.test.tsx
# The tests are grouped in the __tests__ folder, which is located at the level of the component that is being tested.

/public
# Static assets like fonts and images
```
