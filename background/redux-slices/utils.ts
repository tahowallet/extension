 * Create an async thunk action that will always run in the background script,
 * and dispatches lifecycle actions (pending, fulfilled, rejected) on the
 * shared store. The lifecycle actions are observable on synced non-background
 * stores.
 *
 * NOTE: To ensure the action is handled correctly, a central location should
 * add the webext-redux `alias` middleware to the background store, referencing
 * the `allAliases` variable in this module. This variable exposes all async
 * thunks for use with the `alias` middleware.
 *
 * @see {@link createAsyncThunk} for more information on the `options` parameter
 *      and the `pending`, `rejected`, and `fulfilled` properties on the
 *      returned action creator. Also note that the async thunk action creator
 *      returned directly by `createAsyncThunk` is not directly exposed.
 *
 * @param typePrefix This is both the name of the action that starts the thunk
 *        process, and the prefix for the three generated actions that update the
 *        thunk status---`pending`, `rejected`, and `fulfilled`---based on the
 *        payload creator's promise status.
 * @param payloadCreator A function that will always run in the background
 *        script; this takes the action payload and runs an async action whose
 *        result is eventually dispatched normally into the redux store. When
 *        the function is initially invoked, the `typePrefix`-pending action is
 *        dispatched; if the function's returned promise resolves,
 *        `typePrefix`-fulfilled or `typePrefix`-rejected is dispatched on the
 *        store depending on the promise's settled status. When -fulfilled is
 *        dispatched, the payload is the fulfilled value of the promise.
 * @param options Additional options specified by `createAsyncThunk`, including
 *        conditions for executing the thunk vs not.
 *
 * @return A function that takes the payload and returns a plain action for
 *         dispatching on the background store. This function has four
 *         additional properties, which are the same as those returned by
 *         `createAsyncThunk`.
