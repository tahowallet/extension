# Taho Contribution Guide

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç Contributions
are welcome from anyone on the internet, and even the smallest of fixes are
appreciated!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Taho and its
packages. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. While the team
works towards a first release, bigger contributions will be slow-rolled or
temporarily closed. If this happens to you‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry! We‚Äôll be circling back
to them very soon! More below.

## Deciding What to Work On

Taho is currently being built by a core team in collaboration with a community
on the [Taho Community Discord server](https://chat.taho.xyz). **Discord is
the right place to start discussions on new features and bugs.** The community
on Discord, led by a few designated folks will help to funnel these into
well-organized GitHub issues for features and bugs, as well as organize folks
to tackle any issues they‚Äôre interested in. For the time being, the core team
will be charged with reviewing, critiquing, and ultimately merging new work.

‚≠êÔ∏è Check out our ["good first issues" tag](https://github.com/tahowallet/extension/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22üê£+good+first+issue%22) for existing bugs that are more approachable.

## Use Feature Flags

When developing a new feature, please put it behind a feature flag. Because this enables you to open PRs in smaller chunks rather than having the feature completely finished, this will help your contributions get merged faster. It'll also help everyone better QA the feature and time its release! Feature flags are set in [`.env.defaults`](https://github.com/tahowallet/extension/blob/main/.env.defaults) in tandem with [`features.ts`](https://github.com/tahowallet/extension/blob/main/background/features.ts)

## Getting Started

1. Fork tahowallet/tally-extension
2. Clone your fork
3. Follow the [setup
   instructions](https://github.com/tahowallet/tally-extension#building-and-developing).
4. If you find an issue you would like to work on, post a comment indicating
   you‚Äôd like to pick it up. Otherwise, please file an issue indicating what
   you are intending to do‚Äîthere could be a duplicate issue, or someone else
   could already be working on it!
5. Build!
6. Open a PR against the main branch and describe the change the PR has
   implemented. You may break out a larger piece of work over several PRs (in
   fact, we encourage it!). In your PR description, make sure to mark that your
   PR closes the associated issue from step 4.

Before marking the PR as ready for review, make sure:

- It passes the linter checks (`yarn lint`) (see [Pre-commit](#pre-commit) to
  make this automatic).
- All commits are
  [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
- It passes the GitHub checks on GitHub.
- Your changes have sufficient test coverage (e.g regression tests have been
  added for bug fixes, unit tests for new features).

Once a PR is open, it should be acknowledged and a reviewer assigned within 1-2
days (weekends and holidays will probably extend this timeline). At this point
the ball is in the reviewer‚Äôs court, and the reviewer will leave requests for
adjustments or approve and merge the PR when it is ready for inclusion in the
code base.

## Development Tooling

### Commit Signing

Commits on the Taho repository are all required to be signed. No PR will be
merged if it has unsigned commits. See the [GitHub documentation on commit
signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
to get it set up.

### Continuous Integration

Taho uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. All Actions jobs
(including tests, linting) must be green to merge a PR.

### Pre-commit

Pre-commit is a tool to install hooks that check code before commits are made.
It can be helpful to install this, to automatically run linter checks and avoid
pushing code that will not be accepted. Follow the [installation
instructions](https://pre-commit.com) here, and then run pre-commit install to
install the hooks. Note that the `scripts/macos-setup.sh` script should
automatically set this up for you.

### Linting

Linters and formatters for Solidity, JavaScript, Markdown, and other code are
set up and run automatically as part of pre-commit hooks. These are checked
again in CI builds to ensure they have been run and are passing.

If you want to change a rule, or add a custom rule, to the linting, please
propose these changes to our solhint-thesis and eslint-thesis packages. All
other packages have these as a dependency. Note that it is very unlikely
linting changes will be accepted; in general, code formatting and linting is
set in stone and only significant issues will result in adjustments.
